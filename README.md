# module2challenge


This project was created in reponse to our module 2 challenge.

The website is a portfolio in the making to house future projects that are worthy of note.

during this project I learned a LOT about positioning and relativity to containers as well as parents with specific regard to images and text boxes overlayed on them. some other minor fun things were the use of media queries and transitional hover effects.

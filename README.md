# module2challenge


This project was created in reponse to our module 2 challenge.

The website is a portfolio in the making to house future projects that are worthy of note.

during this project I learned a LOT about positioning and relativity to containers as well as parents with specific regard to images and text boxes overlayed on them. some other minor fun things were the use of media queries and transitional hover effects.

the process of learning css was a struggle since its all so alien but after spending some time with several areas of the css styling language its becoming easier and easier. The biggest challenge is to find something you want to do and figure out how that behavior is defined in css terms ie flex box, or grid layout.
